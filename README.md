For position as frontend system developer, UFV-PA 2020/4870

## Description

Welcome applicant!

In this repository you will find an unfinished, a little buggy, web app

### Tasks

All tasks should be done in the form of pull requests towards the repo.
Use one PR for each numbered task you submit.  You can assume that the PRs will
be merged as is, so PRs may be based on the final commit of the previous PR.
The pull requests should include extra files where appropriate and README
updates if functionality is added.

0. Update this readme by adding your full name to the first section so that
   you are easy to identify.

1. The app seems to always compare Uppsala and Ume√• regardless of what the user
   chooses. Fix the app so that it compares the selected cities.

2. After selecting a city the select menu loses focus. Fix the app so that the
   focus is preserved after new data is presented to the user.

3. Change the plotting code to use a library instead. You can choose whichever
   you like but add it as a dependency to package.json. Adapt the data
   preprocessing code if needed.

   You don't need to mimic the current layout of the plot exactly, you are free
   to improve the graph in any way you see fit to make it conform to good
   data visualisation practices. If you do so, document the shortcomings you
   found with the current plot and motivate your improvements.

4. Clean up the rest of the code in this repository, with regards to modern frontend
   development to get it in a shape that you are comfortable with maintaining
   and adding small features to.

Make sure that the development environment and build script works at each
pull request.
