# Weather station comparison app

For position as frontend system developer, UFV-PA 2020/4870

## Description

Welcome _Radu Birzu_!

In this repository you will find an unfinished, a little buggy, web app
that needs to be improved! Its specification is to compare weather
forecast temperature for some major Swedish cities.

Docs to the forecast API is at http://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/metfcst/index.html.

### Tasks

All tasks should be done in the form of pull requests towards the repo.
Use one PR for each numbered task you submit. You can assume that the PRs will
be merged as is, so PRs may be based on the final commit of the previous PR.
The pull requests should include extra files where appropriate and README
updates if functionality is added.

0. Update this readme by adding your full name to the first section so that
   you are easy to identify.

   **Done. Edited the greeting with my name in _italics_.**

1. The app seems to always compare Uppsala and Ume√• regardless of what the user
   chooses. Fix the app so that it compares the selected cities.

   **I found and fixed the bug. The two variables, `stat1` and `stat2`, were supposed to hold the currently selected values from the compare menu. Instead, they were initialized too early. I moved the code to the _onchange_ event function to retain the correct values. I also altered the data returned from the API to also include the name of the cities, which are the select boxes values. The select boxes will reflect the compared cities, upon refresh.**

2. After selecting a city the select menu loses focus. Fix the app so that the
   focus is preserved after new data is presented to the user.

   **I fixed the issue by passing the id of the currently selected item to the main function, in the _onchange_ event and restoring the focus later by using the received id.**

3. Change the plotting code to use a library instead. You can choose whichever
   you like but add it as a dependency to package.json. Adapt the data
   preprocessing code if needed.

   You don't need to mimic the current layout of the plot exactly, you are free
   to improve the graph in any way you see fit to make it conform to good
   data visualisation practices. If you do so, document the shortcomings you
   found with the current plot and motivate your improvements.

   **For plotting the API results, I chose to use a heatmap chart from the [TOAST UI Chart](https://github.com/nhn/tui.chart/blob/main/docs/en/chart-heatmap.md) library. The former implementation was not so appealing and very hard to follow. Besides that, the plotted data was incomplete. There were no station names nor a legend. The library I used is a simple one but efficient. It can be customized as far as it allows us to do so or it can be replaced completely with a more advanced one if needed.**

4. Clean up the rest of the code in this repository, with regards to modern frontend
   development to get it in a shape that you are comfortable with maintaining
   and adding small features to.

   **I upgraded the project with the latest technologies in my opinion. These are [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), and others. This way, the repository is more organized (because of Svelte's components). By using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, its classes can be composed to build any design, directly in the markup. Babel ensures future devs will have access to the latest advancements in JavaScript.**

   **What's new:**

   - **Removed 'Compare' button as it was redundant.**
   - **The selected station from each select box is not available on the other one. In this way, we can avoid having the same station selected in both boxes. The items in each select box are re-built on every change.**

   **Release notes:**

   - **Due to the nature of Tailwind CSS, the starting of the dev server is taking a while. In development mode, Tailwind's build system is not purging the unused atomic classes, which are many. After the project is started, any change will render very fast. This is not the case in production, as Tailwind purges unused classes at build time.**
   - **Build the project as usual and run `npx serve build` to test the production environment, considering that the `npx` tool is already installed.**
   - **I developed the project on a Linux platform. I took all the measures to make it work cross-platform in development. In case something is not working when launching the dev server, please use the production build to test it.**

Make sure that the development environment and build script works at each
pull request.
